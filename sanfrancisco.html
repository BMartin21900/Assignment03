              San Francisco, officially the City and County of San Francisco, is
              a cultural, commercial, and financial center of Northern
              California. San Francisco is the 16th most populous city in the
              United States, and the fourth most populous in California, with
              881,549 residents as of 2019. It covers an area of about 46.89
              square miles (121.4 km2), mostly at the north end of the San
              Francisco Peninsula in the San Francisco Bay Area, making it the
              second most densely populated large U.S. city, and the fifth most
              densely populated U.S. county, behind only four of the five New
              York City boroughs. San Francisco is part of the 12th-largest
              metropolitan statistical area in the United States by population,
              with 4.7 million people, and the fourth-largest by economic
              output, with GDP of $592 billion in 2019. With San Jose, it forms
              the fifth most populous combined statistical area in the United
              States, with 9.67 million residents as of 2019. Colloquial
              nicknames for San Francisco include The City, SF, Frisco and San
              Fran.

        <div class="container">
          <p>
            The earliest archaeological evidence of human habitation of the
            territory of the city of San Francisco dates to 3000 BC. The Yelamu
            group of the Ohlone people resided in a few small villages when an
            overland Spanish exploration party, led by Don Gaspar de PortolÃ¡,
            arrived on November 2, 1769, the first documented European visit to
            San Francisco Bay. The first maritime presence occurred on August 5,
            1775, when San Carlosâ€”commanded by Juan Manuel de Ayalaâ€”became
            the first ship to anchor in the bay. The following year, on March
            28, 1776, the Spanish established the Presidio of San Francisco,
            followed by a mission, Mission San Francisco de AsÃ­s (Mission
            Dolores), established by the Spanish explorer Juan Bautista de Anza.

        <div class="container">
          <p>
            San Francisco is located on the West Coast of the United States at
            the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula and includes
            significant stretches of the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay
            within its boundaries. Several picturesque islandsâ€”Alcatraz,
            Treasure Island and the adjacent Yerba Buena Island, and small
            portions of Alameda Island, Red Rock Island, and Angel Islandâ€”are
            part of the city. Also included are the uninhabited Farallon
            Islands, 27 miles (43 km) offshore in the Pacific Ocean. The
            mainland within the city limits roughly forms a "seven-by-seven-mile
            square", a common local colloquialism referring to the city's shape,
            though its total area, including water, is nearly 232 square miles
            (600 km2).

        <div class="container">
          <p>
            San Francisco has a diversified service economy, with employment
            spread across a wide range of professional services, including
            financial services, tourism, and (increasingly) high technology. In
            2016, approximately 27% of workers were employed in professional
            business services; 14% in leisure and hospitality; 13% in government
            services; 12% in education and health care; 11% in trade,
            transportation, and utilities; and 8% in financial activities. In
            2019, GDP in the five-county San Francisco metropolitan area grew
            3.8% in real terms to $592 billion. Additionally, in 2019 the
            14-county San Joseâ€“San Franciscoâ€“Oakland combined statistical
            area had a GDP of $1.086 trillion, ranking 3rd among CSAs, and ahead
            of all but 16 countries. As of 2019, San Francisco County was the
            7th highest-income county in the United States (among 3,142), with a
            per capita personal income of $139,405. Marin County, directly to
            the north over the Golden Gate Bridge, and San Mateo County,
            directly to the south on the Peninsula, were the 6th and 9th
            highest-income counties respectively.

            The historic center of San Francisco is the northeast quadrant of
            the city anchored by Market Street and the waterfront. It is here
            that the Financial District is centered, with Union Square, the
            principal shopping and hotel district, and the Tenderloin nearby.
            Cable cars carry riders up steep inclines to the summit of Nob Hill,
            once the home of the city's business tycoons, and down to the
            waterfront tourist attractions of Fisherman's Wharf, and Pier 39,
            where many restaurants feature Dungeness crab from a still-active
            fishing industry. Also in this quadrant are Russian Hill, a
            residential neighborhood with the famously crooked Lombard Street;
            North Beach, the city's Little Italy and the former center of the
            Beat Generation; and Telegraph Hill, which features Coit Tower.
            Abutting Russian Hill and North Beach is San Francisco's Chinatown,
            the oldest Chinatown in North America. The South of Market, which
            was once San Francisco's industrial core, has seen significant
            redevelopment following the construction of Oracle Park and an
            infusion of startup companies. New skyscrapers, live-work lofts, and
            condominiums dot the area. Further development is taking place just
            to the south in Mission Bay area, a former railroad yard, which now
            has a second campus of the University of California, San Francisco
            and Chase Center, which opened in 2019 as the new home of the Golden
            State Warriors.

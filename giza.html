            Giza is the second-largest city in Egypt after Cairo and
            fourth-largest city in Africa after Lagos, Kinshasa and Cairo. It is
            the capital of Giza Governate with a total population of 8.8 million
            as of October 2018. It is located on the west bank of the Nile, 4.9
            km southwest of central Cairo, and is a core city of the Greater
            Cairo metropolis. Giza is most famous as the location of the Giza
            Plateau, the site of the some of the most imporessive and ancient
            monuments in the world. Giza is a plateau southwest of modern Cairo
            which served as the necropolis for the royalty of the Old Kingdom of
            Egypt. Most famous for the pyramids of Khufu(completed in c. 2560
            BCE) and the Great Sphinx(built 2500 BCE),recent excavations on the
            plateau have revealed numerous private tomb complexes and workers'
            quarters. The original necropolis of Giza was laid out with amazing
            precision and skill but, once it became associated with the great
            kings of Egypt and their pyramids, attracted the attention of less
            prominent officals of lower rank. These officials had enough money
            and prestige to buy their way into burial plots at Giza but had no
            regard for the symmetry of the original schematics and had their
            tombs dug wherever they found available space. This resulted ina
            number of grave complexes throughout Giza which would not have been
            authorized by the kings who built the famous pyramids which,
            thorughout history, have drawn vistors from around the world.

            Although the Giza plateau is most closely associated with the
            pyramids of Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure, the site was used as early
            as the First Dynasty of Egypt as evidenced by the tomb of the king
            Djet which was found toward the edge of the plateau. Evidence of at
            least one king from the Second Dynasty (Nynetjer) buried at Giza has
            also been found. Further, inscriptions relate how king Khufu had to
            clear many earlier tombs and grave complexes to build the Great
            Pyramid. What happened to the corpses or the grave goods from those
            tombs is not known. The Great Pyramid of Khufu (also known as the
            pyramid of Cheops, the king's Greek name) is the last remaining of
            the ancient Seven Wonders of the World and rises to a height of 481
            feet (147 metres). The pyramid of Khafre is 471 feet tall(144
            metres) and that of Menkaure rises to 213 feet (65 metres). The
            Great Sphinx sits on the eastern side of the plateau apart from the
            pyramids but it is thought it once was an important part of the
            pyramid complex which covered the area. The head of the Sphinx is
            believed by Egyptologists to be that of the king Khafre though
            others contend that represents Khufu. Further on, the great solar
            barge of Khufu, which is the oldest intact ship extant, was found
            buried in a pit near the Great Pyramid in 1954 CE. Dating from
            c.2500 BCE, the ship is 143 feet (43 metres) long and 19 feet (5.9
            metres) wide. Near the Pyramid complex there are a number of smaller
            structures known as the Queens Pyramids. It is uncertain who was
            buried beneath these pyramids but evidence suggests they were the
            tombs of Hetepheres I (Khufu's mother), Meretites (Khufu's wife) and
            a later queen named Henutsen. The pyramids were once encased in
            polished limestone which, according to ancient writers, reflected
            the light of the sun brilliantly. The limestone was stripped away
            over the years for use in other building projects, most notably the
            mosques of Cairo. Of the three major pyramids, however, only
            Menkaure's is seen today without any of its original limestone
            casing; Khafre's Pyramid retains its casing stones at its apex while
            Khufu's has a smaller remainder at its base. The sides of all three
            of the Giza pyramids were oriented astronomically to be precisely
            north-south and east-west within a small fraction of a degree.

            The original layout of the necropolis at Giza seems to have been
            very precise and well-ordered but, after the end of the Old Kingdom,
            other tombs were dug without regard for the original pattern.
            Sometimes they were dug above existing tombs, making present-day
            Giza a wealth of archaeological material. Recent excavations have
            uncovered tombs of high officials, magistrates, and supervisors of
            building projects, as well as monuments honoring the Egyptian
            workers who labored on the pyramids and others who were employed and
            lived in the immediate vicinity. Largely due to engravings and
            etchings from the 19th century and early 20th centuries CE (and
            postcards and calendars of modern times) many people think of the
            Giza plateau and the pyramids as resting in a remote, wind-swept
            desert locale, when in reality it sits at the very edge of urban
            sprawl of Cairo today. In its time it would have also been a center
            of daily activity with many buildings, colonnades, terraces and
            shops. The image of the Giza plateau in the modern day is thus
            vastly different from how it looked during the Fourth Dynasty of
            Egypt when the pyramids were built. There was a worker's village,
            which has been discovered and excavated, around 1300 feet (400
            meters) south of the Great Sphinx where the laborers who worked on
            Menkaure's pyramid lived and those who built Khufu's pyramid founded
            a small village (Khufu's Village) on the far side of the complex.

            Giza experiences a hot desert climate like arid climate (Köppen:
            BWh). Its climate is similar to Cairo, owing to its proximity. Wind
            storms can be frequent across Egypt in spring, bringing Saharan dust
            into the city during the months of March and April. High
            temperatures in winter range from 16 to 20 °C (61 to 68 °F), while
            nighttime lows drop to below 7 °C (45 °F). In summer, the highs are
            40 °C (104 °F), and the lows can drop to about 20 °C (68 °F). Rain
            is infrequent in Giza; snow and freezing temperatures are extremely
            rare. Up to August 2013, the highest recorded temperature was 46 °C
            (115 °F) on 13 June 1965, while the lowest recorded temperature was
            2 °C (36 °F) on 8 January 1966

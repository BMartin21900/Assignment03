            Yangzhou is a prefecture-level city in central Jiangsu Province,
            China. Historically, Yangzhou was one of the wealthiest cities in
            China, known at various periods for its great merchant families,
            poets, artists, and scholars. Its name refers to its former position
            as the capital of the ancient Yangzhou prefecture in imperial China.
            Yangzhou was one of the first cities to benefit from one of the
            earliest world bank loans in China, used to construct Yangzhou
            thermal power station in 1994. Sitting on the north bank of the
            Yangtze, it borders the provincial capital Nanjing to the southwest,
            Huai'an to the north, Yancheng to the northeast, Taizhou to the
            east, and Zhenjiang across the river to the south. Its population
            was 4,414,681 at the 2010 census and its urban area is home to
            2,146,980 inhabitants, including three urban districts, currently in
            the agglomeration.

            Guangling , the first settlement in the Yangzhou area, was founded
            in the Spring and Autumn period. After the defeat of Yue by King
            Fuchai of Wu, a garrison city was built 12 m above the water level
            on the north bank of the Yangtze c. 485 BC. This city in the shape
            of a three by three li square was named Hancheng. The newly built
            Han canal formed a moat around the south and east sides of the city.
            The purpose of Hancheng was to protect Suzhou from naval invasion
            from Qi. During the Han dynasty, Guangling was the seat of Guangling
            Commandery. It constituted a part of the Xu Province, rather than
            the Yang Province, which was covered the entire southeastern part of
            China then. In 590, the city was made the capital of a newly
            established Yang Prefecture, and began to be referred to with its
            current name.

            "FeiCuiBaiCai" is a world famous carved jade and was displayed in
            the Chinese National Pavilions during the EXPO 2010 Shanghai Jade
            carving is one of the oldest carving varieties in China. Jade is
            processed and carved into exquisite crafts, called jade carvings. In
            the process of making, the craftsman can carve the jade into
            exquisite handicrafts after careful design and repeated polishing
            according to the natural color and natural shape of different jade
            materials. There are many types of jade carvings, including large
            works such as figures, utensils, birds and beasts, flowers, and
            small works such as pins, rings, seals, and ornaments. Chinese jade
            carvings enjoy a high reputation in the world. In 2008, jade carving
            was selected into the second batch of national intangible cultural
            heritage list.

            Yangzhou dishes may be one of the reasons why the people of Yangzhou
            are so infatuated with their city. They have an appealing color,
            aroma, taste and appearance. The original color of each ingredient
            is preserved after cooking, and no oily sauce is added, so as to
            retain the fresh flavour of the food. In Yangzhou all dishes,
            whether cheap or expensive, are elaborate. Cooks will not scrimp on
            their work, even with dazhu gansi (Chinese: 大煮干丝; pinyin: dàzhǔ
            gānsī), a popular dish that costs only a few yuan. Dry bean curd is
            made by each restaurant that serves it, so the flavor is guaranteed.
            The cook slices the 1-cm-thick curd into 30 shreds, each one
            paper-thin but none broken, and then stews them for hours with
            chopped bamboo shoots and shelled shrimps in chicken soup. In this
            way the dry bean curd shreds can soak up the flavor of the other
            ingredients, and the soup is clear but savory. Not only Yangzhou
            cooks, but also the ordinary people are conscientious about cooking.

            spots in the west, over 50 in the south and 45 in the north. Most of
            the scenic spots are rocks in diverse postures which are the results
            of long-tem denudation, weathering, collapse and accumulation in the
            historical development. Besides, many inscriptions on precipices
            left in past dynasties are also the highlights in the hill.

            Fuzhou dishes are representative of the Min (which is short for
            Fujian Province) Cuisine that is very much a feature of Fujian
            Province and is one of the Eight Major Cuisines of China . One of
            the most renowned Fuzhou dishes is Fotiaoqiang (Buddha Jumps Over
            the wall). With more than 100 year's history, it is a traditional
            Min Cuisine recipe. It is said to have been created by the wife of a
            Fuzhou official, who in 1876 was entertaining an important member of
            the Fujian Government in his home. His wife, who was an excellent
            cook placed chicken, duck, pork and seafood together into an empty
            wine jar to simmer following a recipe which was known at the time as
            'Full of Blessing and Longevity'. When the dish was served, the
            visitor praised the aroma and the delicious flavor and was so
            impressed that when he returned home he asked the cook – Zheng
            Chunfa to learn how the wife of his host had prepared the food.
            Subsequently, Zheng Chunfa adapted the recipe making it yet more
            fulsome and on the strength of his creation opened a restaurant
            named Juchunyuan where he served it to the delight of his customers.
            One day several talented writers to the restaurant and were served
            with Zheng Chunfa's special version of 'Full of Blessing and
            Longevity'. When he opened the jar in which it had been cooked, the
            diners were so taken with the gorgeous smell that one of them wrote
            a poem about it. In it he said that the smell was so wonderful that
            even a Buddha would stop pattering and jump over the wall to have a
            taste. Hence the name 'Buddha Jumps over the Wall'. Simmered in a
            Shaoxing wine jar using more than twenty ingredients including fish,
            sea cucumber, chicken, pork and mutton, dried scallop, sea-ear,
            needle of bamboo shoot and pigeon egg, this traditional dish is
            widely renowned overseas and is considered the top dish among those
            of the Min Cuisine.
